# LIVENCRYPT 1.1 #
  # Encryption of texts and files #

The first custom text and file encryption application for Linux and Windows. No more depending on the system for encryption, now you can create your own encryptions and there is no quantum computer that can solve the encryption you have done.

In text encryption mode you have the option to create your own templates with the characters in the language you want and the amount you decide. You can activate the password mode that runs when you enter one of the special symbols in the text box. The value to enter in the box is from 0 to 1000. Button in the upper right corner and FAQ to resolve doubts.

In file encryption mode you only have to fill in the boxes with the value you want, there is no limit. When requesting a reference, it gives you the option to enter characters in the encryption and to be decrypted you will have to insert the same reference.

Available for all languages.
